# AWS Reference â€” Secure Application Patterns

- Use API Gateway + Lambda / ECS / EKS patterns with WAF and Cognito / OIDC.
- Use IAM least privilege, resource-based policies where appropriate.
- Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store (secure).
- Enable VPC endpoints for S3 / DynamoDB for private traffic.
- Use AWS Config rules and Security Hub for continuous assessment.
